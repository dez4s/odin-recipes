Recipes Project

Use HTML basics to create Recipe project

This project will build a simple website that will link to different recipes. The website will focus on HTML basics and not on design and visually appealing details.

Retrospective: 

- Created a "Recipes" website with three webpages containing different foods. Added images, steps and instructions to each page and finally linked them to the main page. 
- Use git add and git commit more often to be safe
